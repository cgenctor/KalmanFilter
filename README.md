# KalmanFilter
The Kalman Filter equations are implemented to track the robot <br>
in an image sequence and estimates the robots position, when its hidden behind a <br>
wall. To get measurements of the position of the robot, a simple pattern <br>
matching approach is used, which is based on cross-correlation.
